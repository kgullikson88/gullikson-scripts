# "A Modern Mean Stellar Color and Effective Temperature Sequence for O9V-Y0V Dwarf Stars"

# Eric Mamajek (University of Rochester) 
# Version 2014.09.29
#
# Much of the content (but not all) of this table was incorporated
# into Table 5 of Pecaut & Mamajek (2013, ApJS, 208, 9;
# http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJS..208....9P), so that
# reference should be cited. Parts of this table for A/F/G stars also
# appeared in Table 3 of Pecaut, Mamajek, & Bubar (2012, ApJ 756,
# 154).  For example, Table 5 of Pecaut & Mamajek did not include the
# absolute magnitude and luminosity estimates, nor the properties of
# the LTY dwarfs.
#
# The author's notes on standard stars and the mean properties for
# stars for each dwarf spectral type can be found in the directory at:
# http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/spt/. See further notes and
# caveats after the table. Colors are based on Johnson UBV, 
# Tycho BtVt, Cousins RcIc, 2MASS JHKs, and WISE W1 photometry.

The adopted mean masses and log(age/yr)s for a given dwarf subtype are
tentative.  With only a few minor exceptions (mainly for b-y colors;
see notes below), this is *not* a compilation of values adopted from
similar tables published by other authors. The author's motivation was
to construct a "modern" table of mean stellar parameters based on an
*independent* survey of the literature and catalog values. In the
process, I've made judgements on which stars and stellar
classifications reflect the "modern" MK system.  You can get a sense
of the messiness and care that went into this process by perusing the
spectral type note files in the previously mentioned directory. This
is an independently constructed compendium, and the author will make
small adjustments, corrections, and add content periodically.  Values
in the table marked by a asterisk (*) are very preliminary, and
probably shouldn't be used for any serious calculations yet. -EEM

OB stars: 

A major redux of the Q-method of dereddening in Oct 2011 results in
some shifts to the color scale among the late-O/early-B stars.  There
are no O-B2 stars within the Local Bubble (at least out to 75 pc; this
is a long standing problem with empirical color calibrations,
e.g. Johnson & Morgan 1953), so one must attempt some bootstrap some
dereddening in order to empirically derive the intrinsic color
sequence. To augment the samples of negligibly reddened stars within
75 pc, I have taken a sample of stars which have measured neutral
hydrogen (H I) column densities, as measured through modeling of Lyman
alpha absorption in UV spectra (e.g. Bohlin et al. 1983), then
estimated E(B-V) from adoption of the E(B-V)/N_HI relation from Savage
& Mathis (1979; N(HI)/E(B-V) = 4.8e21 atoms/cm^2/mag). While there may
be intrinsic scatter in the N(HI)/E(B-V) relation through the ISM, we
consider this a useful statistical dereddening technique for getting
at the intrinsic color sequence of hot dwarf stars. While the
E(B-V)/N_HI relation is calibrated using E(B-V)s for hot stars that
rely on an intrinsic SpT vs. color sequence (and hence one could
object that there is some circularity in our calibration scheme), the
*slope* of the relation mostly rely on the HI column densities for hot
stars with relatively large reddenings - hence any zero-point issues
in the color sequence at the <few hundredths of a magnitude level in
the determination of the N(HI)/E(B-V) slope will be negligible, and
will have negligible impact on our "dereddenings" (using N_HI) of our
lightly reddened OB stars.

To piece together the intrinsic Q vs. (B-V)o vs. (U-B)o sequence, we
combine 3 samples: 

(1) Stars from the Hipparcos catalog with S/N > 8 parallaxes that
place the stars within 75 pc, and have "A0V" classifications, and
which have both B-V and U-B photometry in Mermilliod(1991). These will
define the curve in the B-V vs. U-B sequence near zero colors.

(2) Stars with B class and V luminosity class in the Hipparcos catalog
with S/N > 8 parallaxes that place the stars within 75 pc, and which
have both B-V and U-B photometry in Mermilliod(1991). These mostly
define the approximately linear color sequence between ~B3V and ~B9V. 

(3) A subsample of O/early-B spectral standard dwarf and/or subgiant
stars (V or IV luminosity classifications, preferentially within a few
hundred pc) with UBV photometry in the Mermilliod Johnson photometry
compendium, *and* an estimate of the neutral hydrogen column
density. All of the notes on the dereddening of these hot stars and
adopted input parameters are listed in the files (sorted by MK
subtype) in the directory at:
http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/spt/.

If one adopts the Q parameter formula:

Q = (U-B) - 0.72*(B-V)

We have confirmed the Johnson reddening slope - we independently
estimate an average reddening slopes of E(U-B)/E(B-V) = 0.732+-0.010
for the ensemble of all Hipparcos O8-B9 dwarfs with UBV photometry in
the Mermilliod compendium of Johnson photometry. We retain a slope of
0.72 for continuity with published estimates of the "Q" parameter.

The final fits for OB stars (i.e. (U-B)o < 0) are:

(B-V)o = -4.776008156728d-03 + 5.522012574154d-01*Q +
1.151583004497d+00*Q^2 + 1.829921229667d+00*Q^3 +
8.933113140506d-01*Q^4 [-0.32 < (B-V)o < 0.02]

(U-B)o = 6.230566666312d-03 + 1.533217755592d+00*Q +
1.385407188924d+00*Q^2 + 2.167355580182d+00*Q^3 +
1.075207514655d+00*Q^4 [-1.13 < (U-B)o < 0.02]

(U-B)o = -1.368272076317e-02 + 1.590637348534e+00*(B-V) -
1.477363936224e+01*(B-V)^2 + 5.039982446611e+01*(B-V)^3 +
5.472117191781e+02*(B-V)^4 + 9.445941583982e+02*(B-V)^5
[rms = 0.042 mag; -0.32 < (B-V)o < 0.02]

(B-V)o = 8.440163260524e-03 + 5.780296047218e-01*(U-B) +
1.322981897905e+00*(U-B)^2 + 2.141912996160e+00*(U-B)^3 +
1.531076773342e+00*(U-B)^4 + 4.212960258861e-01*(U-B)^5
[rms = 0.016 mag; -1.13 < (U-B)o < 0.02] 

The extinction at V-band was then calculates using the relation
listed in Olson (1975): 

A_V(Johnson) = 3.25*E(B-V) + 0.25*(B-V)o*E(B-V) + 0.05*E(B-V)^2)

Our revised Q-method relations were used to deredden the OB stars.
The calculated E(B-V) values were then used to deredden
the VIJHK photometry so that we could determine the intrinsic color
sequence for the hot stars.

From the reddening parameters in the Asiago photometric database, we
adopted the following reddening relations for our OB stars:

A_I(Cousins) = E(B-V)*(1.805 + 0.024*E(B-V))
A_J(2MASS)   = E(B-V)*(0.832 + 0.013*E(B-V))
A_H(2MASS)   = E(B-V)*(0.527 + 0.009*E(B-V))
A_Ks(2MASS)  = E(B-V)*(0.356 + 0.006*E(B-V)) 

For typical late-O/early-B type stars with (B-V) ~ -0.3, and small
extinctions (like the stars used for our calibrations), these
relations translate to familiar ratios of total-to-selective
extinction of:

A_I/A_V  ~ 0.57 
A_J/A_V  ~ 0.26
A_H/A_V  ~ 0.17
A_Ks/A_V ~ 0.11 

We then deredden the combined UBVIJHKs photometry using these
relations (and the updated Q-method calibration to calculate E(B-V)),
and fit color sequences to the OB stars for those stars that had
reddenings of E(B-V) < 0.3. This was only done for stars that had a
Hipparcos multiplicity flag of Ncomp=1, 2MASS photometry quality flags
of "AAA" for the JHKs photometry (i.e. the highest reliability level
for all 3 near-IR bands), and V-I colors in Hipparcos (which are a mix
of published Cousins V-I colors and values carefully interpolated
using other published color information, see the ESA 1997 Hipparcos &
Tycho volume).

There are very few stars with (V-Ks) < -0.8 that satisfied all of our
criteria, so their intrinsic colors are an extrapolation of these
color relations (and the few points available seem to support the
extrapolation, within the photometric uncertainties).

M Dwarfs:

I *highly* recommend that you use the colors in this table, and
spectral standards recommended in the files in the directory:
http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/spt/. The M standards have
changes significantly since the 1950s-1970s, and the 1990s era
standards used by Kirkpatrick, Henry, and collaborators have been
heavily used over the past two decades. So older compilations of
colors/Teffs from the 1980s and early 1990s are likely to be out of
date primarily due to shifts in the use of accepted standard stars.
Indeed the "dancing" of choice of the standard stars among the M
subtypes was one of the motivations for putting together this table.

L/T/Y Dwarfs: 

The Teffs for L/T dwarfs are drawn from the author's compiled list of
published Teffs for such objects (each type listed had at least 5
published Teff estimates for representative members of that
temperature subclass). I do not yet have note files by each spectral
subtype yet for the L/T/Y dwarfs.

# UPDATES (I'm obviously calling the version #s by year.month.day)

2011.5.11: updated B9.5V-A2V colors very slightly - fixed a minor,
previously unaccounted for discontinuity in V-K vs. B-V sequence,
which had minor <0.01 magnitude effects on other colors.

2011.6.21: fixed typo V-I(F4V) = 0.412 => 0.476 (thanks Rahul Patel,
Stony Brook). Slightly adjusted colors for G2V stars based on updated
discussion on solar color in: http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/sun.txt .

2011.6.26: I've added what I consider to be good consensus values for
V-band bolometric correction (BCv), absolute V magnitude (Mv) and
bolometric luminosities (logL, normalized to Sun) for spectral types
A0V through M7V. The values are discussed in the individual spectral
type files at: http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/spt/ .

2011.6.28: updated Mv, logL for K/M stars by incorporating the
sequence of V-Ks vs. Mv by fitting Neill Reid's photometry for CNS3
(nearby) stars. The fit is (for 2.0 < V-K < 9.1): Mv =
1.018502543505d+01 - 9.263270647616d+00*(V-Ks) +
6.602690052816d+00*(V-Ks)^2 - 2.147548532548d+00*(V-Ks)^3 +
3.874832372602d-01*(V-Ks)^4 - 3.536870767807d-02*(V-Ks)^5 +
1.260298536591d-03*(V-Ks)^6, with the rms = 0.46 mag in Mv.  This
compares fairly well to the V-Ks vs. Mv sequence of Johnson & Apps
(2009). Most of the new Mv values for a given spectral type are
averages of the Mv vs. V-Ks sequence (for an adopted V-Ks) based on
the Johnson & Apps (2009) and custom fit to Reid's photometry
compendium for CNS3 stars. Also made minor shifts to the colors for
M7V (adopting V-Ks=7.30 instead of 7.23).

2011.8.17: I've added a preliminary 2MASS Ks minus WISE W1 color (Ks -
W1) sequence based on the colors of thousands of nearby unreddened
BAFGKM stars. I found an intrinsic color sequence for (Ks-W1) between
-0.05 < (H-Ks) < 0.30 of (Ks-W1) = 3.401881177741d-02 -
1.331277406699e-01*(H-Ks) - 9.041089929636e-01*(H-Ks)^2 +
2.500587445557e+01*(H-Ks)^3 - 5.485829130472e+01*(H-Ks)^4. One can
safely adopt an intrinsic color (Ks-W1) = 0.03 across the AFG dwarf
spectral classes.

2011.8.22: added log10(Teff) and uncertainties (assuming one integer
subtype; i.e. uncertainty in Teff for B5V is simply approximated as
[Teff(B4V)-Teff(B6V)]/2). Added line for O9V and O9.5V. Recheck of BCv
scale of OB stars taking into account Lanz & Hubeny (2003, 2007)
resulted in minute changes to BCv and logL scale. [I have since
removed Teff uncertainties for now]

2011.8.23: added preliminary Teffs for T9V, T9.5V, and Y0V based on
Cushing et al. 2011 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.4678).

2011.8.24: added (b-y) colors for A stars from Crawford 1979. (b-y)
for A0V-A2V from Gray & Garrison 1987, values adopted for 100 < vsini
< 200 km/s bin. (b-y) colors for O9V-B9.5V stars are from Warren
(1976; MNRAS, 174, 111). (b-y) colors for F2V, F5V-F9V from Crawford
1975 (AJ, 80, 955), with F1V, F3V, F4V colors interpolated.

2011.9.17: minor changes to Teff for F0V and F1V, and minor shift in
colors for F1V.

2011.10.4: Bolometric corrections have been edited slightly. The
current values were calculated using the median value calculated for
the adopted Teff from multiple published calibrations, including Lanz
& Hubeny (2003), Code et al. (1976), Balona et al. (1994), Bessell et
al. (1998), Bertone et al. (2004), Flower et al. (1996), Masana et
al. (2006), and Casagrande et al. (2008). While this median value may
not represent the latest, greatest estimate, it does benefit from
representing a concensus of literature calibrations (some of which are
dependent on the same model atmospheres, e.g. Kurucz), and is
relatively insensitive to outlier calibrations. I have added the
column "uBCv" which is a naive estimate of the *systematic*
uncertainty in the BCv(Teff) scale, calculated using the standard
deviation of the BCv values calculated using the various BCv
calibrations as a function of Teff. The meaning of uBCv should not be
taken too literally (more detailed models in the future could
concievably shift the BCv scale at the high and low Teff ends?), but
it is a reasonable estimate of the scatter in the BCv scale given the
published literature. For the M stars, I explicitly omitted Flower
(1996) in the calculations as its BCv(Teff) values were seriously at
odds with the Casagrande et al. (2008) BCv scale. The Flower (1996)
calibration relies heavily on giants, and the Casagrande et
al. calibration draws from modern stellar atmosphere models for cool
stars and a large body of optical/near-IR photometry for dwarf
stars. For example, for Teff = 3300 K, Flower (1996) predicts BCv =
-3.12 mag, while Casagrande et al. (2008) predicts BCv = -1.86
mag. For cooler stars, the Flower (1996) curve should probably be
avoided. Use of erroneous bolometric corrections for M dwarfs could
systematically, and drastically, affect the inferred luminosities (and
hence ages and masses) of pre-MS M stars.

2011.10.8: updated intrinsic (B-V) and (U-B) colors for O9V and O9.5V
stars using updated Q-method calculations in the spectral type files.
I largely recover a color sequence close to the original Johnson
publications.

2011.10.9: updated and screened (B-V), (U-B), Mv, logL, BCv values for
O9V-B3V stars. These take into account the updated Q-method
calibration and some new estimates of Mv among the standard stars, and
the observed main sequence for the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and
Upper Sco (US). Added lines for B1.5V and B2.5V subtypes (b-y colors
are simply interpolated halfway between the integer subtypes).

2011.10.28: used the revised Q-method to deredden Hipparcos OB stars,
and then with the derived Av values, dereddened UBVIJHK magnitudes and
calculated recalculated colors for O9V-B9.5V stars.

2011.11.1: Rewrote discussion on deriving the intrinsic color sequence
of hot OB stars using the Q-method and dereddening of lightly reddened
stars. I've added a column of predicted masses and ages ("lgAge" =
log10(age/yr)) for the mean HR diagram positions using adopted
"protosolar" evolutionary tracks of Bertelli et al. (2009) [Z=0.017,
Y=0.26].

2011.11.21: Reordered columns in table. 

2011.12.2: Removed systematic uncertainty in BCv ("uBCv") and
estimated uncertainty in logTeff (for one subtype uncertainty). J-H
and H-Ks colors for L dwarfs come from mean estimates calculated using
2MASS photometry with <0.1 mag photometric errors for L and T dwarfs
within 0.5 subtype of a given subtype in the DwarfArchives.org
database.

2011.12.3: Using data from DwarfArchives.org, I fit polynomials to
absolute J magnitude vs. subtype for L and T dwarfs. I find (x =
subtype; 0 = 'L0', 10 = 'T0'): M_J = 1.166986798277e+01 +
1.175748107692e+00*x - 6.522381898768e-01*x^2 + 1.992648437227e-01*x^3
- 2.904023621364e-02*x^4 + 2.134433926696e-03*x^5 -
7.715657229082e-05*x^6 + 1.099122975611e-06*x^7. I calculated absolute
K magnitude using this M_J relation and the adopted J-H and H-K colors
for each subtype. Note that the scatter in the absolute J magnitude
vs. subtype is +-0.4 mag, and only 27 L dwarfs and 34 T dwarfs define
the relation.

2011.12.13: Slight revision to adopted masses for FGK stars and added
masses for M0-M6 dwarfs.

2011.12.21: Minor changes to bolometric correction BCv values of A/F/G
stars at the +-0.01 mag level, from inclusion of Masana+2006 and
Bertone+2004 BC values into the consensus estimates of BCv(Teff).

2012.8.17: Minor shifts to mass scale for K5V-M5V stars taking into
account M_Ks vs. mass calibration from Delfosse+2000. Added mass
estimates for late M dwarfs.

2012.11.25: Updated preamble text. Added list of publications citing
this online table.

2012.11.26: Updated Teff and BCv scale for O9V-B3V based on new
assessments of median Teffs (calculated and from literature) for
standard stars. See corresponding updates to notes in individual
spectral type note files in directory at:
http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/spt/ (e.g. O9V.txt, B0V.txt,
etc.).

2012.11.30: Updated/reviewed Teff, BCv, logL for B7V, B8V, A0V based
on reassessment of median Teffs for standards.

2012.12.01: Updated/reviewed Teff, BCv, logL for B8V, B9V, B9.5V based
on reassessment of median Teffs for standards.

2012.12.10: Slight revision to Y0V Teff based on results from Leggett
et al. 2013 (and check on Teffs for T9 and T9.5):
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1210. And added line for T8.5V based on
Teffs from Burgasser et al. 2011, Warren et al. 2007, and Burningham
et al. 2011.

2012.12.27: The M dwarf files in /spt/ are undergoing a major check up
regarding assessing the rank/quality of standards, median colors,
bolometric corrections, Teffs, etc. I've made a preliminary update to
the Teff scale. Changes to colors have been minor, however the effects
on bolometric corrections has been sizeable due to incorporation of
results from Casagrande08, Leggett01, and Golimowski04. The overhaul
should be done within a few weeks. 

2012.12.29: Updated G2V colors and Teff. Updated notes at:
http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/spt/G2V.txt

2013.02.16: Minor updates to logL and Mbol values. Checked logTeff values. 

2013.04.23: Teff, logT, BCv, logL, and Mbol checked, with some minor
updates, for all K subtypes. Minor update to Teff scale for M dwarfs.
Added approximate V-K colors and Mv estimates for L0 through L3 dwarfs
based on Dahn02 photometry.

2013.06.01: Made subtle edits to color tables (usually at 0.001 mag
level) and for thorough update before publication of much of the O9-M9
part of the table in Pecaut & Mamajek (submitted to ApJ). Teff
estimates were re-checked, and minor shifts made for some GKM stars
(usually at <+-50 K level). Added V-Rc colors based on V-Ic to V-R
trend from Caldwell et al. (1993, SAAO Circulars, 15, 1) for B through
mid-M dwarfs, and based on average V-Ic and R-Ic colors for late Ms
from Liebert & Gizis (2006, PASP, 118, 659). Made minors shifts to
mass scale for late O and B stars based on including some results from
eclipsing binary masses.

2013.06.18: Updated parameters for B0.5V stars due to reexamination of
data for Beta Sco Aa (standard star) and B3V (absolute magnitudes).

2013.06.23: Slight shift in absolute magnitude and luminosity for M4V
due to inclusion of individual abs mag estimates for M4V standards.

2013.07.02: Minor shifts to adopted optical colors for M6/M7/M8/M9
dwarfs. The mean V-Ic and V-Rc colors for these late M dwarfs are
uncertain at the ~0.05-0.1 mag level.

2013.07.05: Based on discussion in Pecaut & Mamajek (2013), we adopt
Vmag = -26.71+-0.02 mag and BCv(Sun,G2V) = -0.11. This results in a
systematic shift of the bolometric correction scale at the 0.04 mag
level, where BCv(Sun) = -0.07 (old) => -0.11 (new). I have shifted all
of the BCv and Mbol values to reflect this shift. The new solar BCv
value is commensurate with the revised solar constant from Kopp & Lean
(2011), and revised inferred solar luminosity (Mamajek 2012), and is
calculated as the synthetic V magnitude needed to fit the revised
solar irradiance constant (Kopp & Lean 2011) using Teff=5772K BT-Settl
model using solar composition. Note that the fitting of BT-Settl
models to the empirically derived solar colors from Ramirez12 leads to
a solar effective temperature (5776+-22K) which is spot on with the
measured value (5772K). A slight shift in adopted V magnitude (~0.03
mag level, from V=-26.74 => -26.71) is needed to force the solar
diameter measurements to that predicted from the SED-fitting.  The new
adopted Vmag is similar to that recently derived by Engelke08 using
several different solar spectrum calibrations (their solar V mags are
consistent with V = -26.71+-0.01).

I still need to make the minor shift to the luminosity scale. 

2014.01.23: Updated introduction information to mention Pecaut &
Mamajek (2013).

2014.02.23: Included Tycho Bt-Vt colors based on a new analysis of B-V
vs. Bt-Vt colors of nearby dwarfs stars plus a small number of lightly
reddened O-early-B-type dwarfs. 

2014.03.26: Updated J-H (2MASS system) colors for L3-Y0 dwarfs based
on examination of Figure 5 of Kirkpatrick et al. (2011, ApJS, 197,
19). Updated Mv estimates for L0-L5 dwarfs based on Dieterich+2014 Mvs
as function of V-Ks.

2014.11.14: Fixed equation for Av as function of E(B-V) and (B-V)o. Thanks to Cameron Bell!
