Isochrone Helpers
===================

This package contains a single file, Feiden.py, implements the Dartmouth isochrones in the framework of Timothy Morton's `isochrones code <http://isochrones.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

If upon importing this you get a system exit, then your pymultinest installation is bad. Probably you just need to point LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the proper executable.
